 Projects for Bureau of Meteorology Internship

Various projects I worked on at my time in Tasmania working for the Bureau of Meteorology.
These projects included an exploratory data analysis on a CO2 isotopologue dataset, a cloud classification 
script and a Tekran mercury analyser standard edition microcontroller.
